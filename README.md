A whole ass repo for automated lighting for my halloween party!

It works well. You probably could figure out how to use it if you wanted. You'll need some hardware to make it work (i.e., DMX lights, cables, and a USB to DMX adapter). You'd also need to "make an app" with the Spotify API and get tokens, etc. Then spend a lot of time manually annotating a playlist (yes I did that I'm not sure if its a flex or if its neurotic).

Maybe I'll make it easier for others to use in the future!

Also huge disclaimer: a LLM made this possible. Much of the code is either fully generated by Claude or is at least optimized by it. I think this is ok bc I'm more concerned with throwing a fun party than being smartypants idk. That's the noble thing to say anyway.
