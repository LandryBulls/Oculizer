# Playlist Pulser

The primary goal of this project at this point is to perform audio analysis in real time to map sounds to control DMX lights. 

~~This is an in-development project designed to allow Spotify users to craft the perfect playlist for any
occasion. For example, if you want your Halloween party playlist, which starts at 6:30pm, to have a more chill vibe
while people arrive but then pulse in energy to a peak in intensity and danceability from 10:00pm - 1:00am, you can do that. 
If you also want said playlist so alternate between crowd favorites and your personal favorites, you can also do that while
maintaining the pulse trajectory.~~

~~The code relies on the Spotipy package, which is a wrapper for the Spotify API. You can use it to extract features from music on 
Spotify, like danceability, energy, valence, popularity, and acousticness. This package provides algorithms that use these features 
to generate playlists depending on user preference.~~

~~Future implementations will integrate multisensor audiovisual streams to create an adaptive party environment, where the algorithm
pays attention to the crowd's collective social state and optimizes energy expenditure and enjoyment.~~
